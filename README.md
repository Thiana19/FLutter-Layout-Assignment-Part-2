# FLutter-Layout-Assignment-Part-2
Create a Grid Layout of IoT (Internet of Things) devices in a particular house.  Keep it simple to just 4-6 devices.  Each device will have an icon on its own.  When you press the icon, toggle the image and toggle the text underneath between on and off. Modify your current app to now have tabs.  You can implement tab by having a tabController.
